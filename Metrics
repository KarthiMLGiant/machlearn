AUC score - Area Under Curve Gives the performance of the model. Good model represents to be 1, which means accuracy is 100%, 
            TPR/FPR are 100% prediction by model. Whereas 50% represents bad model, predicts outcome in random probability.
            Hence, business terms to understand the overall performance of model need to verify the better AUC score as threshold.

ROC Curve - TPR vs FPR at every probability setting. 

Gain/lift - It's a measure of the effectiveness of a classification model calculated as the ratio between the results obtained with and without the model.
            confusion matrix that evaluates models on the whole population
            whereas gain or lift chart evaluates model performance in a portion of the population. 
            eg: different credit scores in a predicted outcome, select a portion of the population and determines 10% to 100% counts and 
                respective target%. Same Lift gives the uplift of using model between without the model result.
                when we target first 10% population, target population will be 36% so expected lift by using model will be 3.6
                same we target 100% population, target population will be 100% so expected (response rate) lift by using model will be 1 
                for that overall popualtion.

KS Stats  - Kolmogorov-Smirnov chart  
            K-S is a measure of the degree of separation between the positive and negative distributions.
            It measures the discriminatory power of a model, checks whether the model is able to distinguish between events and non-events
            K-S statistic=100 will mean that the model is able to create two mutually exclusive groups with each group having a separate class 
            label of observations. 
            K-S Statistic=0 indicates a very poor model which fails to successfully distinguish between the classes.

            In our example, as our target is default then KS statistic will be the difference between the Cumulative default and Cumulative Non-defaulters             observations. 
            Higher K-S value means that the model is good at separating the two classes.
            For a good model, the maximum K-S statistic should fall in the top three or four deciles as we expect the maximum differentiation 
            between the churners and non-churners to happen in the initial deciles only.
            both the classes that much measure is able to obtain.
           
        
Gini Score- Area between the random and model line tells us the additional lift that the model is able to get than the traditional. (responder rate)
            Gini coefficient = 2 Ã— AUC-1
            Gini Coefficient tells us about the differentiating power of the model. (between the random and model) 
            In a ROC Curve, it is the area between the random model and the created model (ROC Curve).

Precision - TP/TP+FP

Recall    - TP/TP+FN

CM        - confusion matrix that evaluates models on the whole population

Type I  Error - False Positive
Type II Error - False Negative

Anamoly detection 

One class SVM - OK
