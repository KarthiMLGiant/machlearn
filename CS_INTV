Self Intro

About Projects:
I have created supportive analysis and prediction for Credit scoring like (Consumer/SME)
Product Analytics on consumer/sme using machine learning algorithms ---
Risk customers for MG for MIA specifically post COVID to target the base, 
Clustering on HP customer base High/Medium/Low Affluent base using Used/New/Recon car types and determined the settlement period diff among other clusters.
early settlement customers for HP
Attrition customers in Credit Card 
Cluster Analysis using FD Segmentation 
SME propensity scoring for cross BCL/PL to existing loan takers and <2years SME base since these base doesn't opt for any other loan products
SME Clustering for identifying the High/Medium/Low Affluent in Partnership,Sole_prop,SDN BHD.
In addition to this used polynomial regression model to identify the target age of each industry by constitutions.

Model selection:
When you evaluate which model type
is best suited for achieving your goals, you may want to consider criteria such as the
ease of applying the model, the ease of understanding it and the ease of justifying it.

Use case: Next Best Product Analytics using Machine learning algorithm 
Good customers who just got a credit facility:
Newly approved for a car loan and is GOOD according to risk management. His/Her next step is to purchase a house.
This use case helps to identify the next best offers for customers.

About Credit Scoring:
Credit score are calculate from Data rich credit report
It is used by Financial institutions, telco, insurance and SME to find consumer credit worthiness with right prod offering in relation of risk.
Higher the score, lower the risk.

Debt to income ratio:
- (debt repayment/monthly gross income)

Customer lifetime value:
- It’s an important metric as it costs less to keep existing customers than it does to acquire new ones, 
  so increasing the value of your existing customers is a great way to drive growth.
- attrition helps to retain existing one, CLV helps to acquire new cust as well as retain existing customers.
- Historic CLV and predictive CLV 
- Historic CLV (Customer revenue per year * Duration of the relationship in years -
				Total costs of acquiring and serving the customer)
-  predictive CLV (This is an algorithmic process that takes historical data and 
   uses it to make a smart prediction of how long a customer relationship is likely to last and what its value will be.)
   check the features and model for this ---
- Traditional CLV formula

Evaluation metrics in Credit scoring:
Divergence 		 - measures a score's ability to separate future goods from bads.
Gini coefficient: (indicates model discriminatory)
- The Gini coefficient which is used in the financial industry to evaluate the quality of a credit score model
- Extract the Gini coefficient from the CAP curve.
- Summary statistics of the trade-off curve 
- effectiveness of model in differentiating b/w 'bad' borrowers who will default in future, 'good' borrowers who don't default in future.
- use this metrics to check 
- the Gini coefficient is a ratio that represents how close our model to be a “perfect model” and how far it is from being a “random model.” 
- The model predicted a default and the borrower defaulted 		 — True Positive.
- The model predicted a default and the borrower didn’t default  — False Positive.
- The model predicted no default and the borrower didn’t default — True Negative.
- The model predicted no default and the borrower defaulted 	 — False Negative
- Gini = 2*AUC-1 
- Gini lift, incremental in Gini Coefficient by score segment on improving the existing model

Somers’ D, which is the summary of the CAP (Cumulative Accuracy Profile) curve:
- measure of the ordinal relationship between two variables
- credit score models, it measures the ordinal relationship between the models’ predictions, in terms of PD (Probability of Default)


Client Scorecard:
- Client scoring is a way to develop a consistent client scorecard (or client report card) for every client that a business serves.  

Purpose of scorecard:
Identifying best customers, and providing them with a higher level of service
Identifying worst customers and, in some cases, discontinuing service to them
Finding past customers who have a great score but are now inactive, and re-activating them
Identifying prospects that are similar to your top customers for acquisition efforts
Identifying lost high value customers, and determining why you lost them and how you can improve your performance
